# Token Objects in PHP

## Presentation
Accessing complex structures can be greatly simplified by the use of objects, however objects can be expensive and the more you have the more they cost you in system resources and time wasted converting existing structures into object form. If you want to have an object structure but you don't want the overhead, if you have existing structures that you want to access as objects, or if you are just looking for something insane to pass the time between other presentations, then you need token objects.

Token objects are simple to build and can be put to work in a variety of useful situations. Token objects can be used to create object interfaces to database result sets, command line applications, menu systems and practically anything you can imagine.

This presentation will provide an understanding of what token objects are, how they work, how they are built and how they can be used. Practical examples will be included along with open source PHP code implementing some ready to use token object base classes.
