# APhPLIX, Traditional GUI in Web Applications
### "GUI Classique en Applications Web"

APhPLIX is a toolkit for building dynamic browser-based applications which look, feel and act like traditional window-based applications.

The current trend in web application development is feature rich interactive applications with a look and feel that is reminiscent of traditional desktop GUIs. Web applications that would look more at home running on your desktop than in a web browser.

Technologies such as AJAX & DHTML, which make this type of application possible, have been around for some time, however we are now seeing a massive increase in their proliferation. Google, Yahoo and many others are using these technologies to creating innovative new web based services and multi user, distributed applications that require no client installation and run entirely in a users web browser.

Over the last several years a staggering number of AJAX frameworks, toolkits & components have emerged. Despite this plethora of Ajaxian solutions, very few stand out from the crowd and even fewer offer a complete development solution. While a number of components can usually be found to overcome almost any challenge faced by a developer, these components are often complex and difficult to integrate. Meanwhile, many of the better frameworks are not open source, making them difficult or impossible to modify and often requiring expensive per developer licenses.

Another major failing of the majority of AJAX frameworks is the level of difficulty involved in actually creating an application. The lack of a Rapid Application Development (RAD) environment is an ironic yet typical omission. Any serious AJAX framework should allow a RAD environment to be created easily and this should be one of the first applications to be built.

APhPLIX, unlike the majority of AJAX frameworks, is a complete, open source development solution that incorporates a browser based Rapid Application Development environment. This RAD environment has itself been developed using the APhPLIX toolkit.

Built on a solid, robust PHP back end, APhPLIX includes methods for database access, session handling and file transfers. The modular architecture allows developers to write custom server side functions that can be easily and consistently accessed from the APhPLIX Javascript client.

On the client side APhPLIX consists of a lightweight Javascript core complemented by an array of plug in modules, allowing developers to add or remove functionality as required. The APhPLIX widget library contains an
extensive list of components, many of which can be data bound.

Although the APhPLIX documentation is still somewhat sparse, for the most part the internal code is well documented and a basic programming reference manual along with a getting started guide are available. In addition to this documentation, APhPLIX ships with a number of well documented sample files to help users get started with building applications, widgets & plug in modules.

After completing the initial installation of APhPLIX, the user is presented with a graphical interface allowing the creation of complete applications. Using APhPLIX it is even possible to create data base enabled applications without typing a single line of code.

## Practical Demonstrations:

### APhPLIX Group Flow
APhPLIX Group Flow is a distributed, multiuser task management application with a simple, intuitive drag and drop interface. This application is used internally by the APhPLIX development teem and is an example of the type of dynamic, feature rich application that it is already possible to create with the APhPLIX toolkit. This application was developed in under 20 hours and comprises less than 2000 lines of code.

### APhPLIX Development Studio
APhPLIX Development Studio is the APhPLIX Rapid Application Development environment and was one of the very first applications to be built using the APhPLIX toolkit. APhPLIX Development Studio provides a simple method of creating APhPLIX applications utilizing a WYSIWYG point and click interface.
