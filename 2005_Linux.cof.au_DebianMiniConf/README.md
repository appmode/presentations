# Building custom Debian install CDs with Terraform

## Abstract:

Terraform is a system for building custom Debian-based install CD ISO images. Terraform can be used to create automated install CDs that require little or no user interaction. By default Terraform will create an ISO of a bootable CD to install a base Debian system, and a customized ISO can be easily created to automatically install or clone a specific environment such as when installing a large number of identical machines.
