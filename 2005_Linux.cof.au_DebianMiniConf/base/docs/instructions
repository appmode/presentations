Instructions for using the Terraform system

## ------------------------------- ##
## Build a custom Install CD
## ------------------------------- ##

1) You will need a Debian based Install CD to do use as a base.
	Terraform has been tested and works with Ubuntu (Warty & Hoary) CDs

2) install the Terraform system
	mkdir /usr/share/terraform
	cd /usr/share/terraform
	tar -zxvf terraform
or
	apt-get install terraform

3) build a Terraform ISO source
	Insert the Debian/Ubuntu CD and mount it
	make-terraform

3) stick your install scripts into the apropriate directories
	install-cd/terraform/pre is for scripts to run before the install
	install-cd/terraform/post is for scripts to run after the install
	install-cd/terraform/post-reboot is for scripts to run once after the first reboot

4) Add any modified or extra files
	install-cd/cd-mod is for files to go in the root of the CD
	install-cd/initrd-mod is for files to go in the initrd
	install-cd/system-mod is for files to go in the installed system
	
5) Do not edit anything in install-cd/initrd or install-cd/cd
	if you need to edit one of these files you should copy it to the apropriate
	mod directory and edit it there (see step 4)
	
6) Make an ISO
	make-iso

7) Burn a CD from the ISO

## ------------------------------- ##
## How building an ISO works
## ------------------------------- ##

Have a look at the make-iso script, there are loads of comments and it should not
be to hard to follow what is going on.

The basics of building an ISO are;

1) Copy the base of the install CD
	everything in install-cd/cd is copied to the cd-temp dir
	this forms the base of the install CD

2) Remove unwanted files
	Some unneeded files in the cd-temp dir are removed

3) Copy modifications to the base of the install CD
	anything in install-cd/cd-mod is copied over the top of the cd-temp dir
	existing files with matching names will be overwritten

4) Copy the base of the initrd
	everything from install-cd/initrd is copied to the initrd-temp dir
	this forms the base of the initrd

5) Copy modifications to the initrd
	anything from install-cd/initrd-mod is copied over the top of the initrd-temp dir
	existing files with matching names will be overwritten

6) Copy the install scripts
	everything from install-cd/terraform is copied into the cd-temp dir
	this includes the Terraform installer and your custom install scripts

7) Copy the system modifications
	anything from install-cd/system-mod is copied into the terraform directory in the cd-temp dir
	these files will be copied onto the installed system.

8) Compress the initrd
	compress the contents of the initrd-temp dir
	copy the compressed initrd into the cd-temp dir

9) Make an ISO

## Terraform Directories
## ------------------------------- ##

install-cd/cd-mod
	files in this directory will be copied onto the install CD. Files of the same
	name in the same location will be overwritten. If you wanted to add a file 
	'/install/install.txt' to the CD you would put the file in 
	'install-cd/cd-mod/install/install.txt'

install-cd/initrd-mod
	files in this directory will be copied into the compressed initrd. Files
	of the same name in the same location will be overwritten. If you wanted to 
	add a file '/bin/sh' to the initrd you would put the file in 
	'install-cd/initrd-mod/bin/sh'	
	
install-cd/system-mod
	files in this directory will be copied onto the newly installed sytem. Files
	of the same name in the same location will be overwritten. If you wanted to 
	add a file '/bin/sh' to the installed system you would put the file in 
	'install-cd/system-mod/bin/sh'	

install-cd/terraform/pre
	scripts in this directory will be run before the Terraform installer is run.
	at this point the install CD is mounted at /cdrom , RAID arrays have NOT been
	build and the hard drives have NOT been formated or mounted.

install-cd/terraform/post
	scripts in this directory will be run after the Terraform installer has finished.
	at this point the install CD is mounted at /cdrom and /target/cdrom . the newly
	installed system is mounted at /target .	
	
install-cd/terraform/post-reboot
	scripts in this directory will be copied onto the installed system in /etc/rcS_firstboot/
	and will be run once, the first time the newly installed system reboots. the
	scripts in this directory should be written as if they were running on a normal
	fully installed system. The scripts will not have access to files on the install
	CD as it will not be mounted.
