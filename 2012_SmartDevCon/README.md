# Building Mobile Apps in minutes, Social Coding with appMode.

## Speaker
Flame Herbohn

## Talk description
appMode allows just about anyone to build mobile apps in minutes. In fact, the system is so easy to get started with that even a novice developer can build a "Hello World" app in under 45 seconds, without having to download or install anything. But it's not the core appMode system that allows such rapid development of Mobile Apps, it's the power of Social Coding, the tightly integrated Developers Marketplace, and most importantly the developers who contribute to the development ecosystem by building reusable widgets. This talk will begin with a live demonstration of building a Mobile App in under 45 seconds, followed by a discussion of Mobile App Social Coding, the appMode Developers Marketplace, and most importantly how developers can contribute and earn money from their development work. It will focus on the the benefits of Mobile App Social Coding and the underlying concepts rather than delving too deeply in to the technology involved.
